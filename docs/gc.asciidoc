Expiring messages and Cleaning up
---------------------------------

SMS might not succeed to be delivered. Either because the subscriber is
not reachable anymore or the delivery might have been interrupted. Either
by an administrator restarting the system or a software issue.

=== Expiring messages

When inserting a SMS the expiration time will be set. The GC application
will make a DB query to remove expired SMS atomically. There will be no
log statement about which SMS got removed.

=== Cleaning up

A destination might end-up in a locked state. This can be due a software
glitch on delivery or administrator restart. If a destination is locked
for more than 30 minutes it will be released.
