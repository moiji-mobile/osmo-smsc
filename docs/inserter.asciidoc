Inserter
--------

The inserter is responsible for receiving SMPP DeliverSM and SMPP SubmitSM
messages and storing them in the database. Right now no billing is done but
it would be done when inserting a message. The main purpose is to take the
SMPP message and store a DeliverSM in the database.

Scaling can occur by configuring multiple SMPP interfaces and by starting
multiple instances of the inserter.
