Inserter
--------

The inserter is responsible for receiving SMPP DeliverSM and SMPP SubmitSM
messages and storing them in the database. Right now no billing is done but
it would be done before inserting a message. The message will be re-encoded
and stored as such. Conversion will occur on delivery.

Scaling can occur by configuring multiple SMPP interfaces and by starting
multiple instances of the inserter.
