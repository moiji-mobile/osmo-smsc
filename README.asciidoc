Scalable Smalltalk Short Message Center (SMSC)
----------------------------------------------

Design Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Receive to be delivered SMS by SMPP from multiple connections.
* Deal with SubmitSM and DeliverSM and convert to DeliverSM.
* Be able to have multiple delivery processes.

Design Ideas

Overview

Storage
^^^^^^^

The central storage is planned to be a MongoDB. The reason is that
it supports tailable cursors on capped collections, replication,
atomic update of a document and the write concern for replication.


SMS/SMPP Record
+++++++++++++++

One record will be a single SMPP DeliverSM with meta information.
Most of the information will be extracted for some queries. Most
notable the following fields need to be there:

* Arrival time at the SMSC
* Destination number
* Priority
* Sender Report needed
* Expiration time
* Retry counter
* Scheduled re-transmit time
* Locking information (state + time)
* SMPP DeliverSM message

Event structure
+++++++++++++++

Create small capped collection for notification entries. This allows
one to use a tailable mongo cursor that blocks until an entry has been
inserted into the collection.


Inserter
^^^^^^^^

Receive SMPP SubmitSM/DeliverSM and store in the database for store and
forward. Multiple inserters must be able to run in parallel.

* Use existing Smalltalk SMPP framework to open or listen to connections
* Convert SubmitSM to DeliverSM (this is losing some info...)
* After the content has been inserted add an event


Delivery
^^^^^^^^

The task is to wake up for the next delivery time or when a new SMS has
been inserted into the table. By using a capped collection for the notifcation
collection the cursor will become readable and the system can wake up and
select the message to be delivered. With a system of multiple delivery nodes
running, all of them will wake up but only one will be able to lock the SMPP
record with a CAS and process with the delivery process.

Once a SMS has been picked it will be checked if there are more SMS for this
subscriber and up to four for messages will be blocked and scheduled in the
same delivery run. If the delivery of a message fails the next delivery time
will be set and the delivery worker goes back to waiting for work.

In general we want to avoid two delivery nodes to deliver to the same subscriber.
This might result in a more complicated CAS locking scheme. The first lock would
be to declare interest to deliver to the user and second lock would increase
the lock by checking that no other delivery node has reached that level. Once
that lock level has been reached it can try to find up to four different messages
for delivery on the same TCAP session.

We might decide to put the delivery history (attempts, timestamps, info) into
the record as well to help with debugging.


Clean-up
^^^^^^^^

As the locking process might leave some locked SMS behind and we need to remove
SMS that were never delivered there should be a clean-up task with the following
responsibilities:

* Remove old SMS that could not be delivered
* Reset SMS that are in the pending state for too long
