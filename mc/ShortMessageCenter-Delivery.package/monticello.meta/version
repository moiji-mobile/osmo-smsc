If it is stuck it will block a worker process forever. Add various tests that simulate failure (no response, abort) and add more strong post conditions (all dialogues be gone).Add overload to cancel invocation timers. E.g. an abort on TCAP does not clear the ROSInvocation.For the forwardSM we are not always having a ROSInvocation and start a custom handler.
