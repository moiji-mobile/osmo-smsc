This would have failed in the real world.Open Mongo in the worker thread and pass in the names of the two databases. They can still share the same mongo root as no concurrent queries are being made.Change testcases and add worker in front of everything. In the test we share the same database but that should be fine.' id '2eaf90cf-8db2-4b8d-97a2-212fdf24bd57' date '29 May 2016' time '10:58:13.304953 pm' author 'HolgerHansPeterFreyther' ancestors ((name 'ShortMessageCenter-Delivery-HolgerHansPeterFreyther.29' message 'delivery: Remove and log expired messagesIf the delivery has failed check the expiry time and print it. As we are scheduling SMS anyway we do not need to have a separate removal function.SS7 and SMPP do not use the >>#unrachableMessage: selector but it is better to prepare the code (as we have the test for it).
