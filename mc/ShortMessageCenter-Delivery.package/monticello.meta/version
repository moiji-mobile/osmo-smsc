(name 'ShortMessageCenter-Delivery-HolgerHansPeterFreyther.33' message 'delivery: Work on reliabilityThe SS7 delivery/forwarder is crucial not to get stuck at all. If it is stuck it will block a worker process forever. Add various tests that simulate failure (no response, abort) and add more strong post conditions (all dialogues be gone).Add overload to cancel invocation timers. E.g. an abort on TCAP does not clear the ROSInvocation.For the forwardSM we are not always having a ROSInvocation and start a custom handler.' id '709eabdf-4402-45f9-a5ce-9e13092688bd' date '30 May 2016' time '10:55:59.826327 pm' author 'HolgerHansPeterFreyther' ancestors ((name 'ShortMessageCenter-Delivery-HolgerHansPeterFreyther.32' message 'delivery: Partial test implementationThe previous commit was a bit too hasty. The tests are currently shaping up and a no result SRIForSM will not cause a DNU anymore. The testcase was already in for the fix.
