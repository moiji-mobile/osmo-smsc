It turns out that >>#deliverGroup: and >>#sendMessages: operate on different lists (or it looks like this).Change the grouping of messages to take ownership of messages (update testcase), add an ensure around the normal delivery to make sure to mark any not delivered message. The unlocking of the destination is still done by the outside block.Handle if there is no route for delivery as well. It will be re-scheduled anyway.
